Hello and welcome! You've landed on the homepage for the FIPEX with DCI project. 

The extensive fragmentation of river systems due to damming, road construction, and other development is a problem that many governments, academic institutions, communities, corporations, and environmental groups are trying to solve.  On the path to recovery of longitudinal connectivity (i.e., connectivity from headwaters to ocean / outflow) of river systems many questions arise, including:  

•	How fragmented is a river system?
•	How much of the fragmentation is due to anthropogenic barriers?
•	How much does each barrier contribute to local fragmentation? 
•	How much does each barrier contribute to system-wide fragmentation?
•	How much habitat or proportion of the river will be restored or reconnected by a given project?
•	What kind of habitat will be made available?
•	How can limited funds be used most effectively?

River systems present unique challenges when attempting to assess the impacts of barriers and costs/benefits of habitat restoration and connectivity projects, making answering the above questions difficult, time consuming, or both. The Fish Passage Extension (FIPEX) with Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI) is designed to help address these challenging questions.

The toolset is designed as an integrated 'Add-in' to the Geographic Information System (GIS) software ArcGIS Desktop™ (ArcMap™ 10.4+) by ESRI™.  It provides basic and advanced tools for assessing river systems with respect to their longitudinal connectivity and can assess individual and cumulative impacts of barriers to fish passage such as dams, weirs, and culverts.  FIPEX can be differentiated from other toolsets for river / watershed network analysis in that it leverages the geometric network model provided with the ESRI ArcGIS Desktop™ suite.

By using the geometric network model, the direction of flow can be set and network analyses can be conducted without the need for Digital Elevation Models, careful attention to digitization direction, or other datasets; users simply need river lines  and a river outflow point. 

FIPEX is made freely available courtesy of various developers and sponsoring institutions over the years.
